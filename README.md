# 110 kV / 33 kV Substation â€“ Single Line Diagram (SLD)

This repository contains a Single Line Diagram (SLD) of a **110/33 kV substation**, created in AutoCAD.  
The design is based on standard substation layout practices and transformer configurations.

## âš¡ Key Features
- **Incoming Supply**: 110 kV grid line with circuit breaker, isolator, CT, PT, and lightning arrester.
- **Transformer**: 110/33 kV, 50 MVA power transformer with OLTC.
- **Busbar**: 33 kV bus feeding outgoing feeders.
- **Outgoing Feeders**: 33 kV circuit breakers with protection relays and metering.
